Strategy:

    Algorithm: launchUmlEditor in UserInterface interface

    The launchUmlEditor implementation is selected at runtime, between the GUI and CLI version
    based on arguments received in the main method

Chain of Responsibilities:

    Everything in the requests, validators, and handlers package is related to the chain of
    responsibilities pattern. An initial request is created, and then sent to a mediator for
    validation and handling.

Mediator:

    The mediator registers services (request, validator, and handler), and serves as a central
    point to allow requests to hit each component in a service
